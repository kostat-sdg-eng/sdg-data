target: 'By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency'
title: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP
indicator_name: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP
national_indicator_available: >-
  Reallocated energy use (in Terajoules) divided by gross value added (GVA)
  chained volume measure (CVM).
national_indicator_description: >-
  Units of direct energy used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy
  efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short
  term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures
  are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the
  reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA
  values.

  United Nations' inter-agency mechanism on energy (UN Energy) and the SE4ALL

national_geographical_coverage: Republic of Korea
computation_units: Terajoules per GBP (£m)
computation_definitions: >-
  Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for
  Energy Statistics (IRES), as made up of production plus net imports minus
  international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic
  Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international comparison
  purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
