  Hate crime is defined as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.’ This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison
  Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime - race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity.

  1. A reliable estimate for transgender-identity cannot be produced due to small numbers in the survey  and are therefore not reported. 2. For details of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, see the <a href=
  'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide</a>  to crime statistics for England and Wales. 3. Ethnic group is based on the 2011 Census definition of ethnic group which now includes Chinese in the Asian/Asian
  British group. For more information see section 7.3 of the <a href= 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide.</a> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in
