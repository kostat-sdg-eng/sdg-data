  Woodland certification assesses management practices against agreed environmental standards. Certification requires that wood products are harvested legally and sustainably, and that important wildlife habitats are identified and are not negatively impacted by management.

  The UN identifies a forest as “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ". The definition used in the UK calculations only counts areas where the canopy covers more than
  20%. Certification in the UK began in 1996, with data collation starting in 2001, becoming a regular annual collation in 2004. New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas. Data follows the UN specification for this
  indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
