For example, 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016.   Coverage is limited to England and Wales.   The headline data are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation\u2019s, i.e. age, gender, etc) are published in February.   The 2015 to 2016 Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) ran for the first time a module of questions asking adults whether they were abused as a child. The module on abuse during childhood was added to the self completion section of the CSEW in place of the follow-up questions on serious sexual assault for survey year ending March 2016.   This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_url_text_6":"Link to source","source_active_7":true,"source_url_text_7":"Link to source","source_active_8":true,"source_url_text_8":"Link to source","source_active_9":true,"source_url_text_9":"Link to source","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-10-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/kostat-sdg-eng/sdg-data/commit/06c717e57a4494d04a20835baf6b0c268cc69f25","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-10-31: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/kostat-sdg-eng/sdg-data/commit/0cca8bae0876cdf246b1c0f5ff90e0cd1e9153dd","page_content":""}
