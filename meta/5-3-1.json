Estimates are based on the population estimates by marital status, specifically the population who are 'Single, never married or civil partnered'. Migrants will be included within these population estimates. Estimates try to indicate behaviour by exact age 18 and by exact age 17 and do not take into account; death, divorce or migration which could occur by age 24. For 2014 marriage statistics onwards, ever married will include people entering into a marriage with either an opposite sex or a same sex partner. Same sex couples converting their civil partnership into a marriage will be included with ever married because previous marital status is unknown; therefore within this table we are assuming a previous marital status (before civil partnership) of single, never married or civil partnered.   This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_url_text_6":"Link to source","source_active_7":true,"source_url_text_7":"Link to source","source_active_8":true,"source_url_text_8":"Link to source","source_active_9":true,"source_url_text_9":"Link to source","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-05-08: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/kostat-sdg-eng/sdg-data/commit/115839aca2395d09d2c9e3e598b5e113abef7a53","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-11-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/kostat-sdg-eng/sdg-data/commit/0d6de251c24fe6bed8481b7dd833312312464d09","page_content":""}
