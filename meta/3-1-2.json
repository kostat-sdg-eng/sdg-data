Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included. A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children including stillbirths. A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.","computation_calculations":"The percentage of women giving birth can be calculated by adding the number of maternities in NHS hospitals to the number of maternities in non-NHS hospitals. The number of maternities in NHS and non-NHS hospitals divided by the total number of maternities, multiplied by 100.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel","data_show_map":true,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2014","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Republic of Korea","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthcharacteristicsinenglandandwales","source_url_text_1":"Birth characteristics","source_release_date_1":"16/10/2017","source_next_release_1":"01/10/2018","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"vsob@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_contact_2":"vsob@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_3":"Annual","source_earliest_available_3":"2014","source_geographical_coverage_3":"Republic of Korea","source_url_3":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthcharacteristicsinenglandandwales","source_contact_3":"vsob@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"03-01-02","comments_limitations":"Maternities in medical facilities used as a proxy.
