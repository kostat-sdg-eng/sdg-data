  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - It is the main measure of national output,
  representing the total value of all final goods and services produced in a
  particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services
  produced within a country’s borders in a given year). According to the System
  of National Accounts (SNA), “GDP is the sum of gross value added of all
  resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on
  products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of
  output … GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and services
  (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers’ prices,
  less the value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum
  of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.” Real Gross
  Domestic Product (GDP) - The real GDP refers to the GDP calculated at constant
  prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation
  and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes. Constant price
  estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base
  period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified
  and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current
  period. Employed persons - Persons of working age (usually defined as persons
  aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as a day or a
  week, (i) did some work (even for just one hour) for pay, profit or family
  gain, in cash or in kind, or (ii) were attached to a job or had an enterprise
  from which they were ‘temporarily’ absent during this period (for such reasons
  as illness, maternity, parental leave, holiday, training, industrial dispute).

  Real GDP per employed person = (GDP at constant prices / Total number of
  employed persons) where the numerator and denominator refer to the same
  reference period, for example, the same calendar year. If we call the real GDP
  per employed person “LabProd”, then the annual growth rate of real GDP per
  employed person is calculated as follows - Annual growth rate of real GDP per
  employed person = ((LabProd in year n – LabProd in year n-1) / LabProd in year
  n-1) * 100.
