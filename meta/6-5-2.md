  The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and
  is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is
  defined as “a process which promotes the coordinated development and
  management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic
  and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the
  sustainability of vital ecosystems” (GWP 2010). The concept of IWRM is
  measured in 4 main components - i) Enabling environment - this includes the
  policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the ‘enabling environment’
  for IWRM; ii) Institutions - includes the range and roles of political,
  social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the
  implementation of IWRM; iii) Management Instruments - The tools and activities
  that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices
  between alternative actions; iv) Financing - Budgeting and financing made
  available and used for water resources development and management from various
  sources. The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these
  four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is split into two parts -
  questions concerning the ‘National level’ and ‘Other levels’ respectively.
  ‘Other levels’ includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated
  countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two
  parts address the wording of Target 6.5 ‘implement [IWRM] at all levels …’. To
  further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be
  categorized in a similar way to the survey questions - Degree of
  implementation = Very low (0-9.9); Low (10-29.9); Medium-low (30-49.9);
  Medium-high (50-69.9); High (70-89.9); and Very high (90-100).
