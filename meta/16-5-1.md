  1. Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. 2.
  Due to small numbers, any differences should be interpreted with caution. For
  the period October 2016 to March 2019, 38 of the 43 territorial forces in
  England and Wales provided data covering these crimes. It’s not possible to
  say whether the other 5 forces recorded crimes of this type but didn’t provide
  information or simply didn’t record any such crimes as none were reported.

  These experiemental statistics are based on police recorded crime. As with
  other types of crime, it is recognised that the recorded crime series will not
  provide a good measure of the full extent of criminality as not all offences
  come to the attention of the police. Therefore data should be treated with
  caution.
