#### Maternal mortality in the UK is measured as a rate per 100,000 maternities (defined as women who give birth to a live infant or a stillborn infant at 24 weeks or greater gestation), and *not* a ratio per 100,000 live births, in order to provide a closer approximation of the risk associated with pregnancy. 

#### Maternal deaths are identified through a variety of sources by the MBRRACE-UK collaboration at the NPEU, University of Oxford. Further details of ascertainment methods, additional disaggregations, details of causes of death and recommendations for improving care can be found in the [MBRRACE-UK Saving Lives, Improving Mothersâ€™ Care reports](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports).

The maternal mortality ratio for the UK, following the UN specification, can also be found in the MBRRACE-UK reports using the link above.<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[3.1.1 Maternal mortality ratio (CSV 5.16 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/3-1-1.csv)
