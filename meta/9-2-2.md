  Data on persons employed in the manufacturing sector has been sourced from the
  EMP13 - Employment by industry dataset. These estimates are sourced from the
  Labour Force Survey. The manufacturing sector has been defined in accordance
  with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. For the
  nationality and country of birth figures, the European Economic Area (EEA) is
  defined as the 28 countries of the EU, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
  Swiss nationals are treated as EEA nationals for immigration purposes;
  however, for statistical purposes Switzerland is not included in EEA estimates
  by ONS unless otherwise specified. Other countries are defined in this
  publication as all countries other than the UK and those in the EEA.
