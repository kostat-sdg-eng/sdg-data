  Hate crime is defined as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived, by the
  victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards
  someone based on a personal characteristic.’ This common definition was agreed
  in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service (now the
  National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the
  criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate
  crime - race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation;
  disability; and transgender identity.

  1. A reliable estimate for transgender-identity cannot be produced due to
  small numbers in the survey  and are therefore not reported. 2. For details of
  the Crime Survey for England and Wales, see the <a href=
  'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user
  guide</a>  to crime statistics for England and Wales. 3. Ethnic group is based
  on the 2011 Census definition of ethnic group which now includes Chinese in
  the Asian/Asian British group. For more information see section 7.3 of the <a
  href=
  'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user
  guide.</a> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG
  Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet
  the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in
  collaboration with topic experts.
