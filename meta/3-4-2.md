  1. Suicide rates per 100,000 population have been age-standardised to allow
  comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of
  people of different ages. Suicide rates by age are based on age-specific
  suicide rates per 100,000 population. Age-specific rates are calculated where
  there are fewer than 20 deaths are potentially unreliable. These figures are
  denoted with a 'u' in Source 1. Rates were not calculated where there were
  fewer than 3 death registrations. 2. There has been a change to the standard
  of proof, which is likely to be affecting the 2018 figures, although it is not
  possible to establish whether the higher number of recorded suicide deaths a
  result of this change. Further information can be available here -
