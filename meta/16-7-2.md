  1. Table excludes respondents who answered 'don't know' and those with missing
  answers. 2. Figures for 'Black' and 'Other' ethnic groups for 2014/15 are
  suppressed because the percentage is based on 5 or fewer responses and is
  therefore unavailable. 3. Information about respondents' limiting long term
  illnesses/disabilities are only available for those who completed the online
  version of the survey. 4. Citizenship - Respondents were instructed to select
  all that apply so there will be some overlap between citizenship groups. 5.
  Household income is measured as respondent income combined with the income of
  cohabiting partner (where applicable) from all sources before deductions.
  Response categories changed in 2016/17 and the 'no income' category was
  removed. It's likely that those with no income will have selected 'under
  £5,199' from 2016/17 onwards. The household income categories are defined in
  the 'other information' section.
