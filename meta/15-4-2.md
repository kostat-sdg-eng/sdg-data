  The Green Cover Index is meant to measure the changes of the green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, crop land, etc. – in order to monitor progress on the mountain target.
  The index will provide information on the changes in the vegetation cover
  and, as such, will provide an indication of the status of the conservation of mountain environments.
