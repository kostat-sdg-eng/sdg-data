  Household Expenditure - The expenditure measure includes spending on items
  that are usually purchased frequently (such as food, petrol), as well as less
  frequent expenditure (such as household appliances and furnishings). Housing
  costs such as rent, Council Tax, mortgage payments etc. are excluded from the
  measure, meaning expenditure is counted on an ‘after housing costs’ (AHC) 
  basis. Household Income - The measure we use for income is household
  disposable income, AHC. Disposable income is the amount of money that
  households have available for spending and saving after direct taxes (such as
  Income Tax, National Insurance and Council Tax) and pension contributions have
  been accounted for. It includes earnings from employment, private pensions and
  investments as well as cash benefits provided by the state. Reflecting
  household size - The expenditure and income measures used in this analysis are
  all equivalised. Equivalisation is the process of accounting for the fact that
  households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the
  same standard of living as households with fewer members. Both income and
  expenditure are adjusted using OECD-modified “companion” scales developed for
  AHC measures in thee Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Households below
  average income (HBAI) series.
