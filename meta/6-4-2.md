  The Water Exploitation Index (WEI) presented here shows the annual total fresh water abstraction in a country as a percentage of its long term annual average available water from renewable fresh water resources. This includes water removed from any fresh water source, either permanently
  or temporarily, as well as mine and drainage water and water abstractions from precipitation. Water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded.
