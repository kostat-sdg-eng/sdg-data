computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  Access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as “access to
  clean fuels and technologies” rather than “access to non-solid fuels.” This
  shift will help ensure that health and other “nexus” benefits are better
  counted, and thus realized.
computation_calculations: >-
  Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more
  than US$ 12,746 - per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to
  using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source for
  cooking and the primary reliance on polluting (unclean) fuels and technologies
  use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as zero for regional and global
  estimates.
