The definition used in the UK calculations only counts areas where the canopy covers more than 20%. Certification in the UK began in 1996, with data collation starting in 2001, becoming a regular annual collation in 2004. New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_url_text_6":"Link to source","source_active_7":true,"source_url_text_7":"Link to source","source_active_8":true,"source_url_text_8":"Link to source","source_active_9":true,"source_url_text_9":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-10-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/kostat-sdg-eng/sdg-data/commit/06c717e57a4494d04a20835baf6b0c268cc69f25","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-10-31: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/kostat-sdg-eng/sdg-data/commit/d920a09e50389b8210e2b506c384db07ffa5c112","page_content":""}
