  Assistance Committee (DAC)</a>: A unique international forum of many of the
  largest funders of aid, including 30 DAC Members. The World Bank, IMF and UNDP
  participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC
  defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of
  ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by
  official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their
  executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the
  promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as
  its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant
  element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per
  cent). <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf">Other
  official flows (OOF)</a>: Other official flows (excluding officially supported
  export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do
  not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not
  primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently
  concessional. Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor
  countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral
  aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation
  where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that
  the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the
  form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral
  Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee)
  Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on
  their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to
  classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes
  used can be found on the  <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm">OECD
  website</a>
computation_calculations: >-
  The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International
  Development was summed by donor recipient countries. The DAC classifications
  used in this indicator are 'Least Developed Country', 'Other low income
  countries', 'Lower middle income countries and territories' and 'Upper middle
  income countries and territories'.
