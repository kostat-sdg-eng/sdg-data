  Full-time equivalent (FTE) figures come from the World Bank database.  Headcount values are calculated from the Office for National Statistics' Labour Force Survey. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or
  develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
