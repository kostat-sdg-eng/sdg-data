  1. The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13, and 2017/18 due to
  use of a split-sample experiment in these years. Please refer to the
  publication linked in the sources for further information. 2. The sum of the
  overarching domestic abuse categories are not the sum of the sub- categories,
  as some victims may be included in multiple categories as they can experience
  more than one type of abuse. 3. Data broken down by personal and household
  characteristics are for non-sexual partner abuse. 4. Data for some ethnic
  groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes.
