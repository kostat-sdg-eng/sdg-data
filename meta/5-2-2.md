  1. The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13 due to use of a
  split-sample experiment in these years. Please refer to the publication linked
  in the sources for further information. 2. Data broken down by 'place of
  occurrence', 'relationship with perpetrator' and 'frequency of sexual assault'
  are based on rape or assault by penetration (including attempts) experienced
  since the age of 16. If the victim had experienced more than one sexual
  assault, the most recent incident was reported for place of occurrence and
  relationship with perpetrator. These data use the number of women and girls
  who were victims of sexual assault as the denominator. 3. Data for some ethnic
  groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes. 4. Relationship with
  perpetrator - Other known includes date, friend, neighbour, an acquaintance
  (outside work or school/college/university), person in a position of trust or
  authority (not at work, school or university), colleague/peer from work or
  school/college/university. Percentages may sum to more than 100, as multiple
  perpetrators could be identified.
