  Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees,
  as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with
  remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid
  leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’ contributions in respect of
  their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the
  benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude
  severance and termination pay. For international comparability purposes,
  statistics of earnings used relate to employees’ gross remuneration, i.e. the
  total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes,
  contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life
  insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated
  in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of
  the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.

  It is very important to observe that the ASHE and LFS earnings are not
  directly comparable, and that LFS data is used to disaggregate by disability
  only because ASHE cannot be disaggregated by disability. The LFS data is based
  on the working population and covers age ranges 16 to 64. Data follows the UN
  specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in
  collaboration with topic experts.
