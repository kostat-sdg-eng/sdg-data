  For UK NEETs data, young people are defined as those aged 16 to 24 years. Some data used are seasonally adjusted to remove the effects of seasonal factors and the arrangement of the calendar, this is referred to as being 'seasonally adjusted'. The disability categories of 'Limiting long
  term illness or disability' and 'No limiting long term illness or disability' match the GSS harmonised standard definition of disability.
