  In the OECD classification the term “taxes” is defined as compulsory unrequited payments to total government. The definition of government follows that of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). As disaggregations of total government, central government here refers to the Government
  of the United Kingdom and local government refers, collectively, to the administration of counties or districts, with representatives elected by those who live there.
