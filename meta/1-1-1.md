data_footnote: >-
  As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the
  international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price
  data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October  2015, when the
  World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP.
  Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25
  using the 2005 PPP.
