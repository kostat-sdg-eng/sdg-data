  Please note - This analysis is not representative of the uptake of contraception methods across the whole population. Contraceptives can be obtained from other sources such as GPs or direct from pharmacies, whilst non-prescription items like condoms can be obtained easily without a visit
  to a medical specialist. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
