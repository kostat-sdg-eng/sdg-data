  AGRIS - International System for Agricultural Science and Technology; CAP -
  Common Agriculture Policy; IAEG -  Inter-Agency and Expert Group; IFAD -
  International Fund for Agricultural Development. Food production industries
  are defined using Standard Industrial Classification 2003 (SIC03) from 2000 to
  2008 and Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07) from 2008 onwards.
  SIC03 - SIC division 01 and 05 are used. SIC07 - SIC division 01 and 03 are
  used. Low pay is defined as the value that is two-thirds of median hourly
  earnings and high pay is defined as the value that is 1.5 times median hourly
  earnings. For example, median hourly earnings for full-time employees in 2017
  is £14.00, therefore low pay employees are considered to be anyone earning
  below two-thirds of £14.00, which is £9.33 and high pay full-time employees
  are those earning anything above 1.5 times £14.00, which is £21.00.
